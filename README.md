# Hey, Wait! :raising_hand:
“Hey, Wait!” is a FoundryVTT module allowing a GM to place “event triggers” on a scene. When players collide with these triggers, the game pauses and the scene shifts to the player, allowing a GM to explain the theatre-of-the-mind landscape, if the player has ran into a pack of monsters, or anything else you can think of! The intent is to give GMs a bit of breathing room with a pack of players who love to explore.
